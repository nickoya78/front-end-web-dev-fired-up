      <h3>Salorize Theme</h3>
      <p>
        Solarized is a color scheme for code editors and terminal emulators
        created by Ethan Schoonover. The scheme is available in a light and a
        dark mode. Packages that implement the color scheme have been published
        for many major applications, with some including the scheme
        pre-installed.

      <h3>Dark Theme</h3>
      <p>
        Dark colors can create a sophisticated and formal atmosphere that
        generates calmness and feelings of security. Yet, we also associate
        darkness in color with sorrow and depression, so it is important to
        understand your particular associations or feelings before you choose a
        color.

        A color scheme consists of a combination of colors used in a range of
        design disciplines, from fine art to interior design to graphic design.
        Each color scheme consists of one or more of the twelve colors present
        on the color wheel. By pairing different colors with each other, you can
        create endless color palettes to use in any composition. Different color
        combinations evoke different moods or tones by using color theory and
        color psychology.
